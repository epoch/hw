// Currency Converter App
// Objectives:

// create and use variables
// create and use functions
// HTF

// Find the exchange rate between dollars and pounds
// Store the exchange rate in a variable
// Converting dollars to pounds:

// Store a dollar amount into a variable.
// Convert it to pounds and output "$NN is £NN".
// Converting pounds to dollars:

// Now store a pound amount into a variable.
// Convert it to dollar and output "£NN is $NN."
// Cleaning it up:

// Can you make sure the output is only 2 decimal places?
// Refactoring

// Can you refactor the code so that it uses functions? Write a function dollarsToPounds that takes a dollar number as input and outputs a string of what the pound equivalent is.
// Do the same for poundsToDollars

var exchangeRate = 0.55;

var dollarsToPounds = function(dollar) {
  console.log('$' + dollar + " is £" + (dollar * exchangeRate).toFixed(2));
};

var poundsToDollars = function(pound) {
  console.log('£' + pound + " is $" + (pound / exchangeRate).toFixed(2));
};

dollarsToPounds(20);
poundsToDollars(30);

// This for That App
// Students will build a "this for that" application that pulls words from array and combines them into strings

// Objectives:

// create and use arrays
// create and use variables
// create and use functions
// How to lead the lesson

// Have you seen this website? It's the inspiration for this exercise. We're going to recreate a console version of this site. What does your startup do? Let's practice using arrays to find out!

// Write a function called randomThis() that picks a random "This" element from the array
// Write a function called randomThat() that picks a random "That" element from the array
// Write a function that prints a statement saying: "So.... your startup is basically like a like a this for that?" It should print a new statement each time the function is called.
